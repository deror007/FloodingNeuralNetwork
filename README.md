# FloodingNeuralNetwork
Hello, this is a supervised artificial neural network built from scratch to predict Skelton's mean daily flow.
If you have a clean dataset, this neural network can be used to model a graph.

For the flood dataset to work, you need to include the appropriate directory of the .xlsx file written in the python file. 


The only dependencies used are:
